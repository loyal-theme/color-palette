## Usage Guidelines

- **Contrast & Accessibility**: Colors are designed to provide sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes. Avoid using medium grays (`#7d7d7d`) on dark backgrounds without sufficient spacing or sizing.
- **Semantic Mapping**: Use accent colors (`cyan`, `green`, `orange`, `pink`) for semantic and interactive elements like status indicators, prompts, and path segments.
- **Minimalism**: The palette favors desaturated and non-obtrusive hues. Avoid adding gradients or shadows to maintain visual clarity and consistency.

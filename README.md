# Loyal Theme â€“ Color Palette

This repository defines the color palette used across all configuration projects of the `loyal-theme` organization. The palette is carefully curated to ensure visual consistency, accessibility, and a professional aesthetic across terminals, UI elements, and system integrations.

## Palette Overview

The Loyal Theme palette consists of ten well-balanced colors. These colors are selected to provide harmony between contrast, readability, and subtle expressiveness.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Contrast & Accessibility**: Colors are designed to provide sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes. Avoid using medium grays (`#7d7d7d`) on dark backgrounds without sufficient spacing or sizing.
- **Semantic Mapping**: Use accent colors (`cyan`, `green`, `orange`, `pink`) for semantic and interactive elements like status indicators, prompts, and path segments.
- **Minimalism**: The palette favors desaturated and non-obtrusive hues. Avoid adding gradients or shadows to maintain visual clarity and consistency.
